## DayPlanner Application

## Description

Using the Moment API I have created a simple DayPlanner tool that allows users to enter a task in each hour slot and this will be saved in localstorage. When they return to the page the saved to dos will still be there

* The colour of the timeslots will update based on the current time of day. Grey is for the past, red is current time and green is the future.

* Users can type in the input fields and hit save to record their tasks


## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Moment
